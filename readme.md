# About this project

This project is a simple example of a Python application accessing a SQLite
database. There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY you should run this in a real project, as
it is really, really insecure. Just don't do it. Learn from it, but that's all.

# How do I run this project?

Running a Python program is really simple. Open a terminal, navigate to your
project folder and type

    python test.py
